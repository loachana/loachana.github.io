        <h2>Let us all get started</h2>
        <p>So this is going to be my first post in 
        here so hopefully I may get to do this at least 
        once in a while. Currently working on understanding 
        how writing process works but honestly I have to
        get my shit together to be an entry level writer.
        But you see I am kind of maniac. I will be doing 
        this thing for a while and may or may not continue 
        doing so. By the way this is not the first time
        I am adding at writing. I did this on physical books 
        writing by hand but I have zero idea what I wrote 
        in those books. I am confident that nobody will 
        ever understand those silly nonsense to the same 
        extent that I cannot comprehend my own writing.
        I wanna get serious here. It's COVID-19. Oh boy. 
        You don't know how much I hate the term "virus"
        now. Death toll is about 15,000 at this point and
        that's insane. I just went through my mental calculations
        so it occurred to me that this is about 10 percent deadly.
        Meaning if 10 people get COVID so will one die. States is having 
        a rough time at the moment. Apparently it will last whis whole week.
        President goes through his net worth in the middle of press conference and 
        it makes me feel ashamed of him. I hope tomorrow will be a great day.</p>
