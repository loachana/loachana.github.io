        <h2>Let us all get started</h2>
        <p>So this is going to be my first post in 
        here so hopefully I may get to do this at least 
        once in a while. Currently working on understanding 
        how writing process works but honestly I have to
        get my shit together to be an entry level writer.
        But you see I am kind of maniac. I will be doing 
        this thing for a while and may or may not continue 
        doing so. By the way this is not the first time
        I am adding at writing. I did this on physical books 
        writing by hand but I have zero idea what I wrote 
        in those books. I am confident that nobody will 
        ever understand those silly nonsense to the same 
        extent that I cannot comprehend my own writing.
        I wanna get serious here. It's COVID-19. Oh boy. 
        You don't know how much I hate the term "virus"
        now. Death toll is about 15,000 at this point and
        that's insane. I just went through my mental calculations
        so it occurred to me that this is about 10 percent deadly.
        Meaning if 10 people get COVID so will one die. States is having 
        a rough time at the moment. Apparently it will last whis whole week.
        President goes through his net worth in the middle of press conference and 
        it makes me feel ashamed of him. I hope tomorrow will be a great day.</p>

    <h2>what's next</h2>
    <p>This is going to be really boring I can tell that
    alright. Okay so I am sitting down here untill the 
    COVID disappears which will unlikely to happen within 
    next couple of weeks. Period!. But as boring as it is 
    I thought that we could use this time to do something 
    useful more than doing nothing. I'd say this unexpected 
    lock down over the glob could result a spike of 
    motivation among all people once things went normal. Reason 
    will be that the more pain humans go through they will
    be more immune to it. This could give them extra energy 
    to the normal lifestyle. So is it good?. I think it's good
    for the people who are going to be survived from this. But certainly not 
    for the ones who sacrified themselves. The other thing is 
    that, from what i see, This virus is not death guaranteed  sort of 
    decease. Most people died from this just because they 
    had some longterm disability. Such as heart deceases or 
    diabetes. So when the virus comes in, their body is like 
    oh god I don't have enough power to deal with you. 
    It's very well obvious that being healthy will result 
    for the good. Those well healthy guys will have mild 
    situations and they would be recovered very soon. So 
    I think just do the simple shits that make your body 
    extra stronger. Eat balance diets, Do your damn exercises.
